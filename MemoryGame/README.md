# Overview
Frontend Structure (HTML): The game's layout is defined in main.html, featuring a heading, a dynamically updated score counter, and a grid container where the cards are displayed. A restart button allows players to reset the game at any time.

Styling (CSS): The visual aspects, such as card design, animations, and layout responsiveness, are handled through style.css. This ensures a visually appealing and intuitive user interface, adapting seamlessly across different devices.

Game Logic (JavaScript): The core functionality is scripted in main.js. This includes loading card data from cards.json, implementing the game mechanics like shuffling cards, handling card flips, checking for matches, and tracking the player's score. The game logic is designed to be clear and maintainable, with functions dedicated to specific tasks to facilitate future updates or enhancements.

Data Management (JSON): cards.json stores the card images and names, allowing for easy modification or expansion of the game's content. This separation of data and logic aids in managing the game's assets and can facilitate the addition of new cards or themes.
